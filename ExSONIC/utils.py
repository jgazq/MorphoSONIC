        1.  During simulation initialization, the stimulus current is set to 0, and an
        FInitializeHandler is used to launch an event that will arrive at the time when we want the
        first jump of stim.amp to occur.
        2.  Arrival of this event causes proc toggleStim() to be called.
        3.  toggleStim() assigns a new value to stim.amp, and uses the CVode class's event() method to
        launch two new events.  The first of these will come back in the future to turn off the
        stimulus. The second will come back a bit later, to turn it back on again, and start a new
        cycle.
