# Description

`MorphoSONIC` is a Python+NEURON implementation of **spatially extended representations** of the **multi-Scale Optimized Neuronal Intramembrane Cavitation (SONIC) model [1]** to simulate the distributed electrical response of morphologically realistic neuron representations to acoustic stimuli, as predicted by the *intramembrane cavitation* hypothesis.

This package expands features from the `PySONIC` package (https://github.com/tjjlemaire/PySONIC).

## Content of repository

### Single-compartment (node) models

The package contains a `Node` class that provides a NEURON wrapper around the models defined in the PySONIC package. This class defines a generic section object with a specific membrane dynamics that can be simulated with both punctual electrical and acoustic drives.

### Multi-compartment (spatially-extended) models

The package also contains several classes defining multi-compartmental model expansions, at various spatial scales.

At the nanometer scale, a `RadialModel` class that simulate the behavior of a **nanoscale radially-symmetric model** with central and peripheral compartments. It can be used to model the coupling between an "ultrasound-responsive" sonophore and an "ultrasound-resistant" surrounding membrane (see `usrroundedSonophore` function. As this model is radially symmetric, some adaptation was needed in order to represent it within the *NEURON* environment (check [this link](NEURON_radial_geometry.md) for more details).

At the morphological scale, several models of **unmyelinated and myelinated peripheral fibers** are implemented:
- `SennFiber` implements a spatially-extended nonlinear node (SENN) myelinated fiber model, as defined in Reilly 1985.
- `SweeneyFiber` implements the SENN model variant defined in Sweeney 1987.
- `MRGFiber` implements the double-cable myelinated fiber model defined as in McIntyre 2002.
- `UnmyelinatedFiber` implements an unmyelinated fiber model defined as in Sundt 2015.

Those fiber models can be simulate upon stimulation by different types of **source** objects:
- `IntracellularCurrent` for local intracellular current injection at a specific section.
- `ExtracellularCurrent` for distributed voltage perturbation resulting from current injection at a distant point-source electrode.
- `SectionAcousticSource` for local acoustic perturbation at a specific section.
- `PlanarDiskTransducerSource` for distributed acoustic perturbation resulting from sonication by a distant planar acoustic transducer.

### Membrane mechanisms (NMODL)

Most point-neuron models defined in the PySONIC package have been translated to equivalent membrane mechanisms in **NMODL** language. Please refer to the PySONIC package for a list of these membrane mechanisms.

### Other modules

- `pyhoc`: defines utilities for Python-NEURON communication
- `pymodl`: defines a parser to translate point-neuron models defined in Python into NMODL membrane mechanisms
- `parsers`: command line parsing utilities
- `plt`: graphing utilities
- `constants`: algorithmic constants
- `utils`: generic utilities

## From the command line

### Running simulations

You can easily run simulations of punctual and spatially-extended models using the dedicated command line scripts. To do so, open a terminal in the `scripts` directory.

- Use `run_node_estim.py` for simulations of **point-neuron models** upon **intracellular electrical stimulation**. For instance, a regular-spiking (RS) neuron injected with 10 mA/m2 intracellular current for 30 ms:

```python run_node_estim.py -n RS -A 10 --tstim 30 -p Vm```

- Use `run_node_astim.py` for simulations of **point-neuron models** upon **ultrasonic stimulation**. For instance, a 32 nm radius bilayer sonophore within a regular-spiking (RS) neuron membrane, sonicated at 500 kHz and 100 kPa for 150 ms:

```python run_node_astim.py -n RS -a 32 -f 500 -A 100 --tstim 150 --method sonic -p Qm```

- Use `run_fiber_iextra.py` for simulations of a **peripheral fiber models** (myelinated or unmyelinated) of any diameter and with any number of nodes upon **extracellular electrical stimulation**. For instance, a 20 um diameter, 11 nodes SENN-type myelinated fiber, stimulated at 0.6 mA for 0.1 ms by a cathodal point-source electrode located one internodal distance above the central node:

```python run_fiber_iextra.py --type senn -d 20 --nnodes 11 -A -0.6 --tstim 0.1 -p Vm --compare --section all```

- Use `run_fiber_iintra.py` for simulations of a **peripheral fiber models** (myelinated and unmyelinated) of any diameter and with any number of nodes upon **intracellular electrical stimulation**. For instance, a 20 um diameter, 11 nodes SENN-type fiber, stimulated at 3 nA for 0.1 ms by a anodic current injected intracellularly at the central node:

```python run_fiber_iintra.py --type senn -d 20 --nnodes 11 -A 3 --tstim 0.1 -p Vm --compare --section all```

### Saving and visualizing results

By default, simulation results are neither shown, nor saved.

To view results directly upon simulation completion, you can use the `-p [xxx]` option, where `[xxx]` can be `all` (to plot all resulting variables) or a given variable name (e.g. `Z` for membrane deflection, `Vm` for membrane potential, `Qm` for membrane charge density).

To save simulation results in binary `.pkl` files, you can use the `-s` option. You will be prompted to choose an output directory, unless you also specify it with the `-o <output_directory>` option. Output files are automatically named from model and simulation parameters to avoid ambiguity.

When running simulation batches, it is highly advised to specify the `-s` option in order to save results of each simulation. You can then visualize results at a later stage.

To visualize results, use the `plot_ext_timeseries.py` script. You will be prompted to select the output files containing the simulation(s) results. By default, separate figures will be created for each simulation, showing the time profiles of all resulting variables in the default morphological section of the model. Here again, you can choose to show only a subset of variables using the `-p [xxx]` option, and specify morphological sections of interest with the `--section [xxx]` option. Moreover, if you select a subset of variables, you can visualize resulting profiles across sections in comparative figures wih the `--compare` option.

### morphoSONIC paper simulations

The `/paper/` subfolder contains the scripts used to generate figures reported in the morphoSONIC paper.

Before running the scripts, you will need to specify an output directory to save the figures in. To do so, update the `figdir` variable in the `root.py` module of this subfolder:

`figdir = '/path/to/your/output/directory'`

Once that is done, you can run each script from the command line:

```python figX.py ```

replacing `X` with the appropriate number.

## On the integration of SONIC model representations within *NEURON*

The SONIC model predicts a time-varying capacitance introducing a nonlinear discrepancy between membrane potential and charge density, something that *NEURON* is not natively equipped to deal with. Therefore, several workaround strategies were designed in order to adapt *NEURON* for the numerical simulation of this model, as well as its spatial extension. You can check [this link](NEURON_integration_strategies.md) for fore details.

## Future developments

Here is a list of future developments:

- [ ] Spatial expansion into more complex neuronal morphologies (axons, soma, dendrites)
- [ ] Experimental validation of the fiber models
