Description
============

Python+NEURON implementation of **spatially extended representations** of the **multi-Scale Optimized Neuronal Intramembrane Cavitation (SONIC) model** to compute the distributed electrical response of morphologically realistic neuron representations to acoustic stimuli, as predicted by the *intramembrane cavitation* hypothesis.
